**Rock-Paper-Scissors Game** ðŸŽ®âœ‚

This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game written in Python. It's a command-line program that lets you play against the computer by choosing Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The game then determines the winner based on standard rules.

How It Works ðŸ’¡

The computer randomly selects one of the following:
- Rock
- Paper
- Scissors

You, the user, will input your choice using:
- R for Rock
- P for Paper
- S for Scissors

The program compares the choices and determines the winner:
- Rock beats Scissors
- Paper beats Rock
- Scissors beats Paper
- The game announces whether it's a win, loss, or draw!

Features ðŸŒŸ
* Simple and easy-to-understand logic.
* Uses Python's random module for the computer's choice.
* Fun, lightweight game that runs directly in the terminal.
* A quick way to pass time or learn Python basics!
